## What is Obsidian

The [Obsidian Language](/README.md) is an experimental memory-safe, low-level language

## What is obsidian's status


[Obsidian is still an experiment.](/README.md#project-status) There remain
significant open questions that we need to answer before the project can
consider becoming a production effort. For now, we're focused on exploring this
direction and gaining information to begin answering these questions.

- [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

### How soon can we use Obsidian?

Obsidian is still years away â€” even if the experiment succeeds, it's unlikely that
it will be ready for serious or production use in the next few years. Everything
here is part of a long-term investigation.

### Why make Obsidian public while it's still an experiment?

One of the critical questions we need to answer as part of this experiment is
whether the direction we're exploring with Obsidian has both broad and significant
interest for the industry at large. We feel like this is best answered by
developing the language openly, publicly, and with broad participation.

### How many people are involved in Obsidian?

Prior to going public, Obsidian has had a solo developer involved.

## Why build Obsidian?

See the [project README](/README.md#why-build-obsidian) for an overview of the
motivation for Obsidian. This section dives into specific questions in that space.
